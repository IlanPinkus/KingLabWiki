## IDE - Integrated Development Environment
Gone are the days when we used text editor for writing code. There are now softwares for writing softwares that are called IDE. It includes the compiler, package manager, debugger etc (don't worry if you are not aware of the terms. they are easier than they sound).
The best IDE available for us is IntelliJ â€“ it integrates github, python, has github copilot like features etc. It has debugging capabilities in-built in it and is much better than VSCode. You can download the latest version by requesting a free full-version licence through https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students or opt for the free community edition at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows .

The most popular editor is Visual Studio Code. Note that this is not an IDE but the extensions allows us to use it like an IDE. VS Code is free to downlaod and use.
