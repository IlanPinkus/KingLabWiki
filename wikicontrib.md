# Contributing to the Lab Wiki

Each page of the wiki is a markdown file (.md). You can use this page as a template for creating and formatting your markdown file.
On the github page, simply click "Raw" in the upper right to view the hidden text.
Once your markdown file is complete, it must be commited to the main branch to be added. Please see the Github tutorial for instructions on how to commit, or contact a wiki admin.

## Headings

Use #, ##, or ### to denote headings. Please use ## as a default for a main heading. 

## Adding Images

To add an image, use the following syntax:

![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)

## Adding Links

To create a hyperlink, use the following syntax:

[Link Text](http://example.com)

You can also use the same formatting to link to another page in the wiki.

## Adding Code

To add inline code, use backticks:

`code`

To add a block of code, use triple backticks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
