##MyMechse

The [my.mechse](https://my.mechse.illinois.edu/) website is the homepage for most of the resources you will use to interact with the administrative side of the department. On this site you can request keys/swipe access to different rooms in MEL and MEB, submit purchasing requests, create travel requests, complete your semesterly TA preference form, perform your yearly self-evaluation, and view your class schedule and other records. 

##Keys and Swipe Access
You will need to request keys and/or card access for some rooms at MEL or LUMEB including the lab (MEL 1218) and your office space. To request a physical key navigate to the "Key Request" page on the my.mechse site.

Your request will be sent for approval, once it has been approved you will receive an email that lets you know when you can pick up the requested key. Keys can be picked up from the facilities/reciving office located in LUMEB 1220.
