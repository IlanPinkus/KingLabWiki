### Grocery shopping
The closest grocery shop close to campus area is [Target on Green Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7BVDCbvChajU84Hp7). However, if you don't have a car, I highly recommend investing in subscribing to [Walmart+](https://www.walmart.com/plus), as it provides free delivery for orders $35+, and have much more options for everything. If you have a car, there is also other options you can explore:
1. [Meijer](https://www.meijer.com/)
2. [Sam's Club](https://www.samsclub.com/) (needs subscription)
3. [Costco](https://www.costco.com/) (needs subscription)
