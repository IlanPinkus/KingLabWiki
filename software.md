# Software and Computer Resources

## Software Access
UIUC provides many free softwares. We even get free Microsoft Windows(10 and 11) and Microsoft 365 licences. Visit https://webstore.illinois.edu/shop/ and login using your Illnois ID. Add any software to the cart and checkout. You donâ€™t have to put any card details. After checkout you will get a screen with the installation instruction and licence keys.

# Matlab and Virtual Machines
Matlab is not available for download at the university. We can only use it through another service called Illinois Anywhere (https://techservices.illinois.edu/illinois-anyware/). It is a virtual server that we can use as an alternate to our local machines. But the data is lost after we logout and hence ensure that you save the data on your local disk

# VPN access

# Lab Computers
King Lab has 12 workstations. Note that many people need to share the resources and hence we have a calender through which you can book the timings for a particular workstation. After getting access to the KingLab Calender, got to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlS5YfXGFcA1PmO1cRzOvmQpiYS5Gd-IQXK2Z6SlDuIxqSPw/viewform and choose a workstation according to your requirements. Ensure that no one else has an overlapping slot for the workstation. 
For remote access to the PCs, you need to get registered in the <> and then use Microsoft Remote Desktop Client. The userid and passwrod will be the same as your Illinois ID and the url of the PC would be mechse-wpk-<n>.ad.uillinois.edu. You have to be connect to the university Wi-Fi or use a VPN.
