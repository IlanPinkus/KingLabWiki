# Things to be done when you arrive at UIUC
While not all of these things apply to all incoming students, it certainly applies to international students

## Phone Number (International students)
This should be the first thing you should obtain as soon as you arrive in the US. You have many options in the USA to get a phone number. You can either go with a postpaid (use now, pay later) or prepaid (pay now, user after). Prepaid options are usually cheaper. Most carriers also provide several options concerning data, with limited data options being cheaper). If you decide to go with a prepaid option, I suggest considering [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/) or [Mint](https://www.mintmobile.com/).

## UIUC ISSS Check-in (International students)
You have to complete the ISSS check-in as soon as you arrive in the USA. You can do that using [this link](https://isss.illinois.edu/students/incoming/checkin/)

## i-Card
The UIUC i-Card has many perks including free transportation access in Urbana-Champaign. Some other ID card perks are listed at - https://www.icardperks.uillinois.edu/cms/one.aspx?portalId=830098&pageId=837975. To issue an i-Card, follow [this link](https://icard.uillinois.edu/public/get-card.cfm).

## Request Building access and key to access the office

## Bank Account
As soon as you arrive at UIUC, you should have a bank account. The two major banks available in Urbana-Champaign are [Chase](https://www.chase.com/) and [PNC](https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.html). While PNC is more suited for UIUC students, Chase provides more versatile banking options and perks. If you decide to go with PNC, you can open your account at [Illini Union Bookstore](https://g.co/kgs/tCdYs2X), which is the same location where you will issue the i-card.
You will need to have a valid state ID/Passport to open the bank account. If asked about the SSN while you don't have one yet, just let them know that you will provide that once you receive it.

## Work permit and TCN (International Students)
To issue a work permit and a TCN, you should contact MechSe HR office (currently Angie Scheiwe, younga@illinois.edu) to book an appointment with her. Try to do this as soon as possible.

## Apply for SSN (International Students)
After sorting out the work permit and get confirmation from MechSe HR office, you should start applying for an SSN. Follow [this link](https://isss.illinois.edu/resources/apply_ssn.html) for more information on the process.

## State ID/Driver's License
A state ID is important, and you should issue one as you stay at UIUC. Additionally, you can issue a driver's license and a state ID as a single ID. All of this can be done within any SSA office in Illinois. While [Champaign's SSA office](https://apps.ilsos.gov/facilityfinder/facilityfinder?command=getFacilityDetails&facilityId=151) is the closest to the campus, it is quite crowded if you want to [book an appointment](https://www.ilsos.gov/departments/drivers/appointments/home.html) to do the driving tests. An alternative is to go to [Rantoul's DMV office](https://apps.ilsos.gov/facilityfinder/facilityfinder?command=getFacilityDetails&facilityId=155) instead, where it is based on first-come-first-served basis, and is usually empty.

For the driving computer test, you can find practice exams [here](https://driving-tests.org/illinois/illinois-permit-practice-test/). For the actual driving test part, you will need to bring your own or a friend's car with you to do the test. Rantoul is quite more flexible with the driving exam compared to Champaign's. 

**A Good Tip**: when you apply for the state ID, make sure to ask for the ID that works outside the state too (called *real ID*)

## Get a Credit Card
To apply for a credit card, most likely you will have to wait until you receive your SSN if you don't have one already.

There are a lot of options to get a credit card in the US. You can get one from your bank. Also, you can consider other options like [Discover](https://www.discover.com/) and [CreditOne](https://www.creditonebank.com/). If this is your first credit card, I suggest using Discover. Also, most of credit card issuers have promotional offers to give you some credit ($100~300) at the beginning.

Nevertheless, be careful with credit cards, and spend responsibly! You don't want to start your life with huge debts.

## Submit Transcripts
You are required to submit your transcript if you have not already to the Grainger Engineering School. Follow the guidelines sent to your email or within you graduate degree application concerning that. 

## Submit Tax Review Form (International Students)
You have to submit the tax review form concerning income tax while you are here in the US. For more information, follow [this link](https://www.busfin.uillinois.edu/paying_people/payments_to_foreign_nationals/foreign_national_employees)
